//10/23/2022 For now (not knowing about logging in/logging out or
//signing-up or making a members profile and saving members in the site)
//just make a quick task page. More like a one go/not signed in the page idea. MAKE IT SIMPLE
//*GOALS*
//1. SHOW PLUS SIGN FIRST UNDER NAVBAR SO WHEN CLICKED, IT WILL HAVE TEXT-BOX AND USER CAN TYPE ITS TASKS/REMINDER
//2. WHEN FIRST TASKS IN COMPLETE AND SHOWED, HAVE MINUS SIGN ON THE RIGHT SIDE, AN EMPTY CIRCLE ON THE LEFT SIDE AND
//   PLUS SIGN ABOVE/OR BELOW(NOT SURE WHAT SIDE YET)
//........THATS WOULD BE A GOOD START AND ADD MORE GOALS/STEPS AS I GO AFTER ONE STEP IS DONE
